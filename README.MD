# Aesthetic Decisions

- **Desktop/homescreen: chill**
  - Calming, spacious designs to underly busy windows and icons
- **Lockscreen: exciting**
  - Anything goes
  - Better with a neat and tidy lock screen
    - Samsung Galaxy users can use [LockStar](https://galaxystore.samsung.com/detail/com.samsung.systemui.lockstar) to keep things clean
- **Floaters**
  - To be centered on the screen
  - Usually t-shirt designs
- **Terminal: elegant and subdued**
  - Extremely simple, standardized designs on the opposite side from the text
