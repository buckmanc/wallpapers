# Usage

## Nab Individual {repo name cap}

Long press / right click > save link. Just don't save the thumbnail by mistake!

## One Big Zip File

You can always download everything as [one big zip file]({repo url}/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

## Shallow Clone

If using Git, I recommend making a shallow clone of this repo to pull only the current images and not the full history. A shallow [update script](update.sh) is included for ease of use and scheduling.

To make a simple shallow clone:
```shell
git clone --depth 1 {repo url}
```

Or to clone only the directories you want in a shallow fashion (for example, to ignore the {mobile size} mobile folder):
```shell
# shallow clone but download and checkout bupkis
git clone --filter=blob:none --no-checkout --depth 1 {repo url}

# set git to only clone these folders
git sparse-checkout set ./desktop ./terminal ./scripts

# download and checkout
git checkout main

```

# Aesthetic Decisions

- **Desktop/homescreen: chill**
  - Calming, spacious designs to underly busy windows and icons
- **Lockscreen: exciting**
  - Anything goes
  - Better with a neat and tidy lock screen
- **Floaters**
  - To be centered on the screen
  - Usually t-shirt designs
- **Terminal: elegant and subdued**
  - Extremely simple, standardized designs on the opposite side from the text
